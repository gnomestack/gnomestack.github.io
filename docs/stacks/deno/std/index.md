title: Std
---

The Standard ("std") module is on x.nest.land as gs-std.  The std currently
extends the deno std library and may pull more code from it later to create
parity modules for node and bun at a later date, where possible.

The current iteration of the std library focuses on enabling scripting and
automation.
