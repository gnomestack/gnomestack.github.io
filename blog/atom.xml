        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Adventures in software development, automation, home labs, being a former
start up employee, and other misadventures.</p>
<p>I'm building gnomestack for .net and deno because they have underrated potential
for general automation and to speed up application development.</p>
<p>Join me for more misadventures.</p>
<p>Part of gnomestack will be used to build out gnomelabs (homelabs).</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_otLt" id="why-deno">Why Deno<a href="https://gnomestack.github.io/blog/welcome#why-deno" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Deno" title="Direct link to Why Deno">​</a></h2>
<p>Deno has a focus on serverless though it sometimes fees like it doesn't know
what it wants to be as it tried to avoid package.json only to come back and
support node packages later.</p>
<p>Deno's potential for automation lies within the use of es6 modules, its support
for compiling to byte code, supprt for foreign function interfaces, and its
ability easily install scripts as cli tools.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_otLt" id="why-net">Why .NET<a href="https://gnomestack.github.io/blog/welcome#why-net" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why .NET" title="Direct link to Why .NET">​</a></h2>
<p>.NET seems to attract those obsessed with patterns, particularly the repository
and CQRS and its backing company errs on the side of collecting too much data
in a telemetry happy frenzy.</p>
<p>Regardless, .NET has made insane improvements to the BCL, cross platform support
for .NET Core, source generators, and introduced native compliation.</p>
<p>The built in support for windows and the support for other systems are
continously improved makes it a strong candidate for building cross platform
tools.</p>]]></content>
